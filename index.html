        <p class="mb-2">
          At You-N-Me, we believe in creating meaningful connections that go
          beyond just dating. Our platform is designed to bring people together
          from around the world, helping them build real-life relationships
          while bridging language and cultural differences.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Unlike traditional dating apps, You-N-Me serves as a relationship

          We prioritize privacy and security, taking steps to minimize scams and
          ensure a trustworthy experience. Our approach is built around the 3
